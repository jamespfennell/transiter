# This ensures that if we change the Go source code we don't have to redo all of
# these (slow) steps again when building the Docker image, due to Docker's 
# incremental caching.

# (2) Next, we perform an optional step in which we re-generate all of the sqlc and
# proto code and validate that it matches what's in source control.
# The idea is to make sure the repo is internally consistent and that the Docker image
# we're building actually reflects what's in the .proto and .sql files.

# (2.1) Install all the code generation tools.

    """
    Install a system

    This endpoint is used to install or update transit systems.
    Installs/updates can be performed asynchronously (recommended)
    or synchronously (using the optional URL parameter `sync=true`; not recommended);
    see below for more information.

    The endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` requests.
    There is a single required parameter, `config_file`, which
    specifies the YAML configuration file for the Transit system.
    (There is a [dedicated documentation page](systems.md) concerned with creating transit system configuration files.)
    The parameter can either be:

    - A file upload of the configuration file, or
    - A text string, which will be interpreted as a URL pointing to the configuration file.

    In addition, depending on the configuration file, the endpoint will also accept extra text form data parameters.
    These additional parameters are used for things like API keys, which are different
    for each user installing the transit system.
    The configuration file will customize certain information using the parameters -
        for example, it might include an API key as a GET parameter in a feed URL.
    If you are installing a system using a YAML configuration provided by someone else, you
     should be advised of which additional parameters are needed.
    If you attempt to install a system without the required parameters, the install will fail and
    the response will detail which parameters you're missing.

    #### Async versus sync

    Often the install/update process is long because it often involves performing
    large feed updates
    of static feeds - for example, in the case of the New York City Subway,
    an install takes close to two minutes.
    If you perform a synchronous install, the install request is liable
    to timeout - for example, Gunicorn by default terminates HTTP
    requests that take over 60 seconds.
    For this reason you should generally install asynchronously.

    After triggering the install asynchronously, you can track its
    progress by hitting the `GET` system endpoint repeatedly.

    Synchronous installs are supported and useful when writing new
    transit system configs, in which case getting feedback from a single request
    is quicker.

    Return code         | Description
    --------------------|-------------
    `201 CREATED`       | For synchronous installs, returned if the transit system was successfully installed.
    `202 ACCEPTED`      | For asynchronous installs, returned if the install is successfully triggered. This does not necessarily mean the system will be succesfully installed.
    `400 BAD REQUEST`   | Returned if the YAML configuration file cannot be retrieved. For synchronous installs, this code is also returned if there is any kind of install error.

    Uninstall (delete) a system

    The uninstall can be performed asynchronously or synchronously (using the

    You should almost always use the asynchronous version of this endpoint.
    It works by changing the system ID to be a new "random" ID, and then performs
    the delete asynchronously.
    This means that at soon as the HTTP request ends (within a few milliseconds)
    the system is invisible to users, and available for installing a new system.

    The actual delete takes up to a few minutes for large transit systems like
    the NYC Subway.

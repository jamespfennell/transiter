# Public API resources

The public API is Transiter's main API and
is used to query transit data from Transiter.
It's a read-only API and designed to be reachable from the internet.

Transiter's other API is the private [admin API](admin.md) which is used to manage the Transiter deployment.

The public API is based on the following resource hierarchy:

```
System
|- Agency
|- Alert
|- Feed
|- Route
|   |- Trip
|- Shape
|- Stop
|- Transfer
|- Vehicle
```

For each resource there is a protobuf message type, a list endpoint, and a get endpoint.
In the HTTP API, the structure of the response is based on the protobuf message type.

The URLs in the HTTP API are determined by the resource hierarchy; thus:

- List all systems has URL `/systems`,
- Get system with ID `<system_id>` has URL `/systems/<system_id>`,
- List all routes in the system has URL `/systems/<system_id>/routes`,
- Get route has URL `/systems/<system_id>/routes/<route_id>`,

and so on.

The following table summarizes all of the resources and their types.
The right-most column describes the _source_ of the resource.
The public API is a read-only API so all of the resources come from somewhere else.

| Resource              | List endpoint                                       | Get endpoint                                    | Source               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |----------------------|
| [Agency](#agency)     | [ListAgencies](public_endpoints.md#list-agencies)   | [GetAgency](public_endpoints.md#get-agency)     | GTFS static          |
| [Alert](#alert)       | [ListAlerts](public_endpoints.md#list-alerts)       | [GetAlert](public_endpoints.md#get-alert)       | GTFS realtime        |
| [Feed](#feed)         | [ListFeeds](public_endpoints.md#list-feeds)         | [GetFeed](public_endpoints.md#get-feed)         | System configuration |
| [Route](#route)       | [ListRoutes](public_endpoints.md#list-routes)       | [GetRoute](public_endpoints.md#get-route)       | GTFS static          |
| [Shape](#shape)       | [ListShapes](public_endpoints.md#list-shapes)       | [GetShape](public_endpoints.md#get-shape)       | GTFS static          |
| [Stop](#stop)         | [ListStops](public_endpoints.md#list-stops)         | [GetStop](public_endpoints.md#get-stop)         | GTFS static          |
| [System](#system)     | [ListSystems](public_endpoints.md#list-systems)     | [GetSystem](public_endpoints.md#get-system)     | System configuration |
| [Transfer](#transfer) | [ListTransfers](public_endpoints.md#list-transfers) | [GetTransfer](public_endpoints.md#get-transfer) | GTFS static          |
| [Trip](#trip)         | [ListTrips](public_endpoints.md#list-trips)         | [GetTrip](public_endpoints.md#get-trip)         | GTFS realtime        |
| [Vehicle](#vehicle)   | [ListVehicles](public_endpoints.md#list-vehicles)   | [GetVehicle](public_endpoints.md#get-vehicle)   | GTFS realtime        |

Many resources refer to other resources across the hierarchy.
For example, each route has an agency it is attached to.
Each stop has a list of service maps, and each service map contains a set of routes.
In these situations the resource message contains a _reference_ to the other resource.
The [Route](#route) message contains an agency reference, in the form of an [Agency.Reference](#agencyreference)
message.
These reference messages contain at least enough information to uniquely identify the resource.
However they also contain additional information that is considered generally useful.
For example, the [Stop.Reference](#stopreference) message contains the stop's name.
What counts as "considered generally" is obviously subjective and open to change.

## Feed

The feed resource.

Each feed is defined in the system configuration file.
Feeds are included in the public API because there are non-admin use-cases for this resource.
For example, an app might publish the staleness of realtime data
  by checking the last successful feed update time.

More detailed information on a feed -- its full configuration, and the
  current status of its periodic updates -- can be retrieved through the
  [admin API's GetSystemConfig endpoint](admin.md#get-the-config-for-a-system).

| last_update_ms | int64 | Unix milliseconds timestamp of when the last update of this feed finished. There are three outcomes for each update: successful (new data is retrieved from the transit agency and persisted), skipped (the transit agency returned the same data as the last update, so there is nothing to do), and failed (something went wrong, e.g. the transit agency's feed is unavailable).
| last_successful_update_ms | int64 | Unix milliseconds timestamp of when the last successful update of this feed finished.
| last_skipped_update_ms | int64 | Unix milliseconds timestamp of when the last skipped update of this feed finished.

# Public API resources

Public API

The Transiter public API is based around hierarchal resources, like many REST APIs.
This is the resource hierarchy:

```
System
|- Agency
|- Alert
|- Feed
|- Route
|   |- Trip
|       |- Vehicle with no ID
|- Stop
|- Transfer
|- Vehicle with ID
```

For each resource there is a proto message type, a list endpoint, and a get endpoints.
For stops, the message is [Stop](#stop), the list endpoint is [ListStops], and the get endpoint is [GetStop].

The URLs in the HTTP API are determined by the hierarchy; thus:

- List all systems has URL `/systems`,
- Get system with ID `<system_id>` has URL `/systems/<system_id>`,
- List all routes in the system has URL `/systems/<system_id>/routes`,
- Get route has URL `/systems/<system_id>/routes/<route_id>`,

and so on.

Many resources refer to other resources across the hierarchy.
For example, each route has an agency it is attached to.
Each stop has a list of service maps, each of which contains a set of routes.
In these situations the resource message contains a _reference_ to the other resource.
The [Route](#route) message contains an agency reference, in the form of an [Agency.Reference](#agencyreference)
message.
These reference messages contain at least enough information to uniquely identify the resource.
However they also contain additional information that is considered generally useful;
thus, the [Stop.Reference](#stopreference) message contains the stop's name.
What counts as "considered generally" is obviously very subjective and open to change.

The following table summarizes all of the resources and their types.
The right-most column describes the source_of the resource.
The public API is a read-only API so all of the resources come from somewhere else.

| Resource    | Reference type | List endpoint | Get endpoint | Source |

## Endpoints


## Get the config for a system

`GET /systems/<system_id>/config`

### Request type: GetSystemConfigRequest


	


| Field | Type |  Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| system_id | string | 








### Response type: [SystemConfig](admin.md#SystemConfig)

## Install or update a system

`PUT /systems/<system_id>`

Installs or updates the system based on the configuration provided in the
request payload.
If the system does not exist an install is performed; otherwise an update.

### Request type: InstallOrUpdateSystemRequest


	


| Field | Type |  Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| system_id | string | ID of the system to install or update.
| system_config | [SystemConfig](admin.md#SystemConfig) | 
| yaml_config | [TextConfig](admin.md#TextConfig) | TODO: TextConfig json_config = 4;
| install_only | bool | If true, do not perform an update if the system already exists. TODO: rename skip_update = 4; ?
| synchronous | bool | If false (the default), the system configuration is validated before the request finishes but databse updates are performed asynchronously. The status of the operation can be polled using GetSystem and inspecting the status field.<br /><br />If true, the install/update operation is perfomed synchronously in the request and in a single database transaction. In this case, if the operation fails there will no database artifacts. The problem is that installs can take a long time and the request may be cancelled before it completes e.g. by an intermediate proxy.

No fields.







## Update a feed

`POST /systems/<system_id>/feeds/<feed_id>`

Triggers a feed update for the specified feed.

### Request type: UpdateFeedRequest

## Get scheduler status

`GET /scheduler`

Gets the status of the scheduler.

### Request type: GetSchedulerStatusRequest


	


No fields.







### Response type: GetSchedulerStatusReply


	


| Field | Type |  Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

## Reset scheduler

`POST /scheduler`

Performs a full restart of the scheduler, with all scheduler
  configurations retrieved fresh from the database.
In general this endpoint should never be needed;
  Transiter automatically restarts the scheduler when needed.
 The main usecase is when the Postgres configuration is manually
  updated and the scheduler needs to see the update.

### Request type: ResetSchedulerRequest


	


No fields.







### Response type: ResetSchedulerReply


	


No fields.







## Garbage collect feed updates

`POST /gcfeedupdates`

Deletes feed updates that are older than a week, with the exception that
the most recent succesful update for each feed is always retained.

This method exists to avoid unbounded growth in the feed updates database table.
It is called periodically by the scheduler.

### Request type: GarbageCollectFeedUpdatesRequest


	


No fields.







### Response type: GarbageCollectFeedUpdatesReply


	


No fields.










## Types


### FeedConfig


	


| Field | Type |  Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| id | string | Identifier of this feed config. This must be unique within the system.
| required_for_install | bool | If true, an update of this feed will be performed during the system installation, and if the update fails the system installation will fail.
| update_strategy | [FeedConfig.UpdateStrategy](admin.md#FeedConfig.UpdateStrategy) | 
| update_period_s | double | 
| url | string | URL at which the feed can be downloaded using a HTTP GET request. Transiter does not currently support non-GET requests.
| request_timeout_ms | int64 | Timeout to enforce for the request to the feed URL. If not specified, defaults to 5 seconds.
| http_headers | [FeedConfig.HttpHeadersEntry](admin.md#FeedConfig.HttpHeadersEntry) | HTTP headers to send in the request.
| parser | string | The parser to parse the feed with. Current options are "GTFS_STATIC", "GTFS_REALTIME" and "NYCT_SUBWAY_CSV".<br /><br />The are future plans to support plugging in additional custom parsers at build time. This is why the field is a string and not an enum.
| gtfs_realtime_options | [GtfsRealtimeOptions](admin.md#GtfsRealtimeOptions) | Additional options for the GTFS realtime parser, if that is the parser in use.






#### FeedConfig.HttpHeadersEntry


	


| Field | Type |  Description |

### GtfsRealtimeOptions

Message describing options for the GTFS realtime parser.

| nyct_alerts_options | [GtfsRealtimeOptions.NyctAlertsOptions](admin.md#GtfsRealtimeOptions.NyctAlertsOptions) | 
| reassign_stop_sequences | bool | If true, stop sequences in the GTFS realtime feed data are ignored, and alternative stop sequences are generated and assigned by Transiter. This setting is designed for buggy GTFS realtime feeds in which stop sequences (incorrectly) change between updates. In many cases Transiter is able to generate stop sequences that are correct and stable across updates.<br /><br />This should not be used for systems where a trip can call at the same stop multiple times.

In particular, a one-off trip whose bucket only contains itself will be excluded if there are many other trips.<br /><br />Note that a trip's schedule is reversed if needed based on the direction ID.
